# Overview

As a software engineer continually seeking to enhance my skills and knowledge, I embarked on developing a To-Do List web application. This project serves as a practical endeavor to deepen my understanding of React and its ecosystem. The application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, marking tasks as completed, and deleting them. 

To start the application on your local machine, you need to have Node.js installed. Once installed, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run `npm start`. This command boots up a development server, and you can view the application by opening `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

The purpose behind creating this software was to explore interactive web development techniques and improve my ability to build user-centric applications. This project has been a valuable step in my journey as a developer, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting.

# Web Pages

The To-Do List application is a single-page application (SPA) that dynamically updates based on user interactions, without the need for page reloads. Here's how it works:
- **Main Page**: This is the primary interface where users can add new tasks using a text input field and a submission button. Below the input field, the added tasks are displayed. Each task has options to mark it as complete, which toggles the appearance of the task to show it's done, and a delete button to remove the task from the list.

# Development Environment

The development of this web application utilized the following tools and technologies:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, chosen for its efficiency in rendering dynamic content and managing state.
- **Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)**: Used for running the development server and managing project dependencies.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and managing code.
- **Create React App**: A command-line tool that scaffolds out a new React project, providing a solid base to start with.

# Useful Websites

Here are some websites that were invaluable in the development of this project:
* [React Official Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

# Future Work

Several enhancements and features are planned for future iterations of the To-Do List app:
* **Persistence**: Implementing local storage or backend integration to save tasks between sessions.
* **Task Prioritization**: Adding functionality to prioritize tasks and sort them accordingly.
* **User Authentication**: Introducing user accounts to allow multiple users to manage their to-do lists independently.
